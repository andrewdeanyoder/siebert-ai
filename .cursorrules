# Cursor Rules for Siebert Science AI

## Project Overview
This is an AI-powered anatomy and physiology tutoring application built with Next.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. The AI tutor specializes in evidence-based learning strategies and cognitive neuroscience principles.

## Key Technologies
- Next.js 15.4.2 with App Router
- React 19.1.0
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS v4 for styling
- AI SDK for OpenAI integration
- Eslint and Prettier for linting
- pnpm as package manager

## Architecture Guidelines
- **Component Extraction**: When a component becomes longer than 50-60 lines, consider extracting reusable parts into separate components.
- **Single Responsibility**: Each component should have one clear purpose. If a component handles multiple concerns, break it down.
- Keep constants centralized in `src/constants.ts`.
- Use the App Router pattern with `src/app/` directory structure.
- Reference `docs/architecture/current-architecture.md` before planning any new work.
- Update `docs/architecture/current-architecture.md` after performing any work.
- The system prompt in `prompts.ts` is critical. Do NOT change it unless explicitly instructed.

## Development Workflow
- ðŸš¨ CRITICAL: Always work in small increments. Implement the smallest change needed to complete a task. NO EXCEPTIONS.
- ðŸš« PREOPTIMIZATION FORBIDDEN: Do not add complexity, variants, or "future-proofing" features. Build exactly what is requested, nothing more.
- Reference `docs/instructions.md` before starting a new task.
- Follow test driven development. Before writing production code, write failing tests first.
- When writing production code, attempt to make the failing tests pass. Do NOT attempt to modify the test to make it pass.
- After completing each unit of work, run the lint, build and test commands and attempt to fix any failures.
- Do NOT commit code unless explicitly instructed.
- Use pnpm for package management (`pnpm install`, `pnpm dev`, etc.)

## Code Style
- Use TypeScript interfaces for all component props
- Prefer explict types instead of `any`
- Follow React functional component patterns with hooks
- Use Tailwind CSS classes for styling
- Maintain consistent error handling patterns
- Prefer destructuring props in component parameters

## Testing Guidelines
- **Follow Test-Driven Development (TDD)**: Write failing tests first, then implement code to make them pass; Important: if the tests do not run, do not continue with development!
- **Test User Behavior, Not Implementation**: Focus on what users can do/see, not internal functions
- **Prefer Integration Tests**: Test components and features working together, not isolated units
- **Minimize Mocks**: Only mock external dependencies (APIs, file system), not internal logic
- **Use Arrange-Act-Assert Pattern**: Structure tests as setup â†’ action â†’ verification
- **Test File Organization**:
  - Unit tests: `tests/unit/ComponentName.test.tsx`
  - Integration tests: `tests/integration/FeatureName.test.ts`
  - E2E tests: `tests/e2e/UserWorkflow.spec.ts`
- **Test Naming**: Use descriptive names like "should display error when API fails" not "test1"
- **Coverage Focus**: Aim for meaningful coverage of user workflows, not 100% line coverage
- **Selectors preference**: Prefer semantic elements (button, input, etc.) and aria-role attributes over CSS classes. Fall back to data-testid for complex selectors.

## File Organization
- Keep components in `src/components/`
- API routes in `src/app/api/`
- Constants and configuration in `src/constants.ts`
- System prompts in `src/app/prompts.ts`
- Global styles in `src/app/globals.css`

## UI/UX Guidelines
- Maintain the existing chat interface design
- Keep the responsive design with max-width constraints
- Preserve any loading states and disabled states
- Maintain accessibility with proper ARIA labels and keyboard navigation
